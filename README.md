# COSI 137: Information Extraction - Brandeis University
Description: Information extraction is an important sub-discipline within Natural Language Processing focused on extracting semantically meaningful information from unstructured data. 
Extracted data include mentions of entities, relationships between entities, descriptions and temporal orderings of events, topic information, text classification, sentiment analysis and more. 
This course will focus on contemporary statistical and machine learning (esp. deep learning) approaches to developing information extraction systems in a data-driven manner. 
Assignments are programming-focused and will make use of popular deep learning frameworks such as MXnet/Gluon and/or Pytorch.

## Course Plan:
* **Deep Learning Fundamnetals** 
    * Common approaches and neural architectures for learning representations suitable for information extraction tasks.
* **Text Categorication** 
    * Convolutional and recurrent architectures for text classification.
* **Named Entity Recognition and Sequence Modeling** 
    * Classical and deep learning approaches for sequence modeling with application to named entity extraction, part-of-speech tagging and dialog act modeling.
* **Self-attention and Transformers** 
    * An overview of common (self-)attention based deep learning approaches, specifically Transformers and pre-trained models such as BERT.
* **Topic Modeling** 
    * Neural variational inference for topic modeling. Relationships between topic modeling and other types of information extraction tasks.
* **Relation Extraction** 
    * Extracting relations between nominals. An overview of classical machine learning and deep learning-based methods.
* **Temporal Information Extraction** 
    * Extracting events and temporal relations between them.
* **Sentiment Analysis**
    * Extraction of metadata beyond semantics: intent, sentiment, author characteristics, style, etc.
